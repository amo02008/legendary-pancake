password generator
## My Task
This project's task was to create a random password based on criteria the client specified to generate a secure, random password.

## What I did
Instead of using prompts and alerts to determine what letters, numbers and special charactes the user would want to include I created a table. This will allow the user to check off all or any one of the criteria. That seemed more user friendly and easier to code out.
